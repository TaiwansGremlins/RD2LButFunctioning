# RD2LButFunctioning
Site Name TBD, will have a built in league creator with admin tools to handle drafts, bans, and stand ins. Probably will flesh out the details more on that when I have a full API ready to use

First steps will be creating the API.

If you wish to contribute, for some reason, create a MR and shoot a message on what you've done. Front end will eventually be react js. Nothing else since React is already super easy.

To start, make sure you have a dev keys file that matches what is in prod, with the appropriate API keys where necessary. Steam ID will be required, as well as a mongo db developer key.
DO NOT push up your dev key or I will blacklist you.
